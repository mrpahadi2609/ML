This avoids introducing ordinal relationships.\n",

        "We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before fitting a model to the data for several important reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Understanding the Data: EDA helps you get a clear understanding of the dataset, including its structure, features, and relationships. This understanding is crucial for making informed decisions about data preparation and modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Identifying Patterns and Trends: By visualizing the data, you can spot patterns, trends, or anomalies that might influence the modeling process. This can help you choose the right features and models.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Detecting Missing Values and Outliers: EDA allows you to identify missing values and outliers in the dataset. Understanding how to handle these issues is essential, as they can significantly affect model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Feature Relationships: You can analyze the relationships between features and the target variable. This insight can guide you in feature selection or engineering, ensuring that you include the most relevant variables in your model.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Choosing the Right Model: EDA can inform you about the distribution of your data and the types of relationships present. For example, if the target variable is categorical, you might consider classification algorithms, while a continuous target might lead you to regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Assumptions Checking: Many machine learning algorithms have underlying assumptions about the data (e.g., linearity, normality). EDA helps you check whether your data meets these assumptions, allowing you to choose the appropriate algorithms.\n",

        "7. Improving Model Performance: By gaining insights from EDA, you can refine your data preprocessing steps, which can lead to better model performance and more accurate predictions.\n",
